# word_search
The purpose of this project is to create a simple 
game where the player selects a word from within 
a group of randomly generated alphabets. 
 The progress till now has been the generation of 
unique random numbers, it is done so by first randomly 
adding numbers into an array then replacing the repeated ones
with numbers that are unique. Then displaying 
the respective numbers with respect to the alphabets assigned to it 
in the texture. In each execution a random word is selected and 
passed into the the final array through which we can see that atleast one 
word is always present among the random alphabets.
